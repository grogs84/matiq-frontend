# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the MatIQ Frontend application. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and their consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help teams:

- **Remember the reasoning** behind important decisions
- **Communicate decisions** to current and future team members  
- **Avoid re-litigating** settled architectural questions
- **Learn from past decisions** and their outcomes

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The situation that prompted the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|------|---------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-tailwind-css-adoption.md) | Adoption of Tailwind CSS as Primary Styling Solution | ✅ Accepted | 2024-12-19 | Decision to migrate from traditional CSS to Tailwind CSS utility-first approach for improved maintainability and performance |
| [ADR-002](./ADR-002-component-composition-patterns.md) | Component Composition Patterns and Architecture | ✅ Accepted | 2024-12-19 | Adoption of React composition patterns (children, render props, HOCs) for better code reusability and maintainability |

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions, create a new ADR:

1. **Copy the template** from an existing ADR
2. **Number sequentially** (ADR-003, ADR-004, etc.)
3. **Use descriptive titles** that clearly indicate the decision
4. **Follow the standard format** for consistency
5. **Update this index** with the new ADR

### ADR Naming Convention

```
ADR-XXX-brief-decision-description.md
```

Examples:
- `ADR-001-tailwind-css-adoption.md`
- `ADR-002-component-composition-patterns.md`
- `ADR-003-state-management-approach.md`

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:

- **Affect system architecture** or major technical direction
- **Have long-term consequences** that are hard to reverse
- **Involve trade-offs** between different approaches
- **Require team alignment** on approach or standards
- **Establish patterns** that other developers should follow

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create ADRs for:

- **Minor implementation details** that don't affect architecture
- **Temporary solutions** that will be changed soon
- **Obvious decisions** with no meaningful alternatives
- **Personal preferences** without architectural impact

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: ADR is drafted and under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Team has agreed to the decision
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Reviewing ADRs

ADRs should be reviewed periodically to:

- **Assess outcomes** of architectural decisions
- **Update status** if decisions change
- **Learn from experience** and improve future decisions
- **Identify superseded** decisions that need updating

Suggested review schedule:
- **Quarterly**: Review recent ADRs for early outcomes
- **Annually**: Comprehensive review of all ADRs
- **As needed**: When considering related architectural changes
